    <h3>About myself:</h3>
    <p>Mike munene, former IT student at Africa Nazarene University, and I chose to learn to program considering it is an important tool that lets us create eco-friendly solutions for global problems and also because its fun.

      I also happen to be passionate about sports, Rugby in particular and I play amatuer Kenyan rugby at local side Homeboyz rfc.
